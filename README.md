# CountingDicePips
Python/OpenCV code for counting the number of pips on a dice face.

I found this project from a job posting and thought it was interesting as I had never done anything in the
computer vision space before.  I implemented this project in python instead of C++.  See the Count Dice Dots Instructions
pdf file for the basis for this function.
